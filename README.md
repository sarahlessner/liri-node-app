# LIRI BOT

### Overview

My first application using Node.js. LIRI BOT is a language interpretation and recognition interface. The app takes in parameters and gives users data based on that input. This application is a back end application only.

With this app users can:

* Display the twenty most recent tweets of a puppy twitter account and the time they were created.

* Search Spotify for a song by song name

	* Searches Spotify API and returns all matches for song names, includes a preview link as well as the album the song is on.

* Search OMDB (movie database)
	
	* Returns the following:

	   * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
